# Bolt Lengths
Make sure you use the exact bolt lengths specified. Too short, and the part may not be secured enough. Too long, and you can break plastic or strip it. You'll be driving the bolts directly into plastic holes, so repeatedly screwing and unscrewing the bolts will damage the plastic and you'll have to reprint the part.  You're better off using a manual driver, since an electric one with too much torque can strip the plastic.

* Case bottom: 2x 12mm
* Case top: 2x 16mm
* Motors: 4x 8mm
* Motor controllers / buck: 8x 6mm. You dont need 4 bolts per controller - 2 per will do
* Servo clamp: 2x 6mm
* Servo driver: 1x 10mm - 12mm. You want to drive this one as far as it goes without having the bolt head tight against the actuator arm
* Pen bolt - 6mm. Just tight enough so the pen is secured. You dont need bolts on both sides - just one will do
* Screen clamp - 2x 8mm
* PD clamp - 2x 8mm
* ESP32 - 2x 6mm - same as motor controllers, no need to use 4 bolts, just 2 will do
